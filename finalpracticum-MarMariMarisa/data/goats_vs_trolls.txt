Once upon a time in a far-off ADJECTIVE land, a herd of ADJECTIVE goats were grazing peacefully on a grassy hillside when they were ADVERB ambushed by a NOUN of ADJECTIVE trolls. The trolls, who were hungry and ADJECTIVE , chased the goats across the hillside, trying to catch them for dinner. But the goats were quick and ADJECTIVE , and they managed to outmaneuver the trolls at every turn. In the end, the trolls were left ADJECTIVE and empty-handed, while the goats made it ADVERB back to their ADJECTIVE home in the hills. And they all lived ADVERB ever after, with the goats keeping a watchful eye out for any more trouble from the ADJECTIVE trolls.
